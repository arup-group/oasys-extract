## Creating a New Release

Create a new release by updating anything in the `extract` folder in the master branch. If you want to bump the first digit e.g. `0.0.1` to `1.0.1` then include the string `(MAJOR)` in the commit message. If you want to bump the second digit e.g. `0.0.1` to `0.1.0` then include the string `(MINOR)` to the commit message.
